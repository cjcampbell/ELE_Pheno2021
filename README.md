# ELE_Pheno2021

`R` subdir contains a comparison of Fric et al. model re-runs (they look identical to RR-22) and a double-check of LS's response terms as documented in the .Rmd file (looks good, abs not swapped).
`scripts` contains code for species-specific linear models of the 22 focal species from LS using pheno.data. Model coefficients look very similar to LS.
